# Compatibility

Like Isotope, Prototope is targeted towards relatively **modern browsers**. Thus, it officially supports only the browsers that support the [ECMAScript 2015 (ES6)](https://caniuse.com/#feat=es6) standard, which is about **93%** of the market.

## Older browsers

With that said, with additional setup, you can get both Isotope, as well as Prototope to work on older browsers. You can find more details about this [here](https://areknawo.com/isotope#docs>compatibility).
